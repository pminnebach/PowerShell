# PowerShell
Some PowerShell scripts that make my life and work easier.

## Scripts
* `New-Module`: For creating PowerShell Modules. Creates a folder in either the default current users PSModulePath, or one that is provided with the -Path parameter. It also creates an empty .psm1 file in which you can put your functions. And a module manifest in a .psd1 file.

## Modules
* None yet.
